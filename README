NAME
    Module::Install::Contributors - add an "x_contributors" section to your
    META.yml

SYNOPSIS
    In your Makefile.PL:

     contributors "Alan Smithee", "Nicolas Bourbaki <nic@math.example.fr>";
     contributors "Spartacus <spartacus@example.it>";

DESCRIPTION
    This is a plugin for Module::Install. It adds a "x_contributors" section
    to your META.yml file. This is an array of strings, which should
    normally be in "Name <email>" format.

    It provides one function to Module::Install-based Makefile.PLs:

    "contributors(@names)"

    Repeated calls are cumulative. The example in the SYNOPSIS has three
    contributors, not just Spartacus.
